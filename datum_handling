After some bad starts we need to revise how FEQ and FEQUTL handle datums under
the new system.  I had originally setup FEQUTL to do some vertical datum shifting.
However that has run into some conflicts.  Thus we want to back out and now force
FEQUTL to check for the vertical datum and the unit system.  We need to make sure
that no unshifted datum sneaks through.  The same for the unit system.  The 
horizontal grid is not yet effective other than a point of information.  The 
same for the basis.  The EASTING and NORTHING values of course are for the horizontal
grid so their value is of secondary use right now.  They may play a greater 
role in future. 

First trial at a rule:

1. The default values for the location/datum items if their input is missing
is "MISSING".     The default value of G_ZONE is "OMIT".  We will set all the 
other global values to the same default value. 

2. If G_ZONE is the default value.  We will not change any value for the table
location/datum info.  They will remain whatever they are and if they are at the
default-only ZONE need be at the default, they will not be printed anywhere. 
In this mode master input files that no nothing of these values should 
results that are the same. 

3.  Remove any global datum shift.  Thus FEQUTL will not do any changing, just 
like FEQ but more so.  There will be no shift of any kind.  The datum will be defined
by what is in the input. 

4.  If one of the loc/datum items is not default then all of them must be except
for the EASTING and NORTHING values.  

5. If G_VDATUM is not OMIT, then its value must be matched for every function
table in run except if a function table with the value of NONE for VDATUM appears.

6. If G_UNITSYS is not OMIT, same as for G_VDATUM.
